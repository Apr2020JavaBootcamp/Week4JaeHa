            <p class="lead"><strong>This week we moved into the meat of Java, which is object-oriented programming.
            Object-oriented programming is one of the main strengths of Java. It allows you to divide your code into
            different modules, called objects,each with their own designated function. You can then utilize these
            objects to do specific things. </strong></p>
            <h4>What is OOP?</h4>
            <ul class="p-main">
                <li><strong>Classes and Objects: </strong>Originally programs were functional, or top-down. All programs
                    had a single entry point and worked their way down, line by line, to a single exit point. They could
                    jump around with various routines and go-to statements but all code was basically one large file.
                    And it got cumbersome.</li>
                <li><strong>Division of labor: </strong>Somehow the idea emerged that you could have a programmer
                    develop code in units or blocks or what is now known as "classes". And these classes could be
                    developed simultaneously and put together in a larger program. And re-used in other programs. And
                    also tested independently. Once tested, they wouldn't have to be tested again.</li>
                <li><strong>What goes into a class? </strong>Each class should have one purpose. Maybe you need a
                    Calendar class to display calendars and perform date arithmetic. Or an Invoice class to
                    display/print an invoice and perform all the calculations. Or an Encryption class which can take
                    some text or a file and return an encrypted version of each. Each class can be used to create
                    objects. These will contain the data and any processing methods to fulfill the purpose of the
                    class.</li>
                <li><strong>Differences between classes and objects: </strong>The class is the code that will be
                    executed, the type of data to be saved and the way it interacts with other things. The object is a
                    particular instance of the class.</li>
                <li><strong>Encapsulation: </strong>Encapsulation is the idea that your class is a black box. When we
                    say something is a black box, that means what goes inside the object doesn't matter to the user.
                    You just need to interact with the class through its interface. </li>
                <li><strong>Interfaces: </strong>The interface is those methods which are publicly available for use by
                    other programmers.</li>
                <li><strong>Extending a class: </strong>A more generalized class like "Animal" can be extended to a more
                    specialized class like "Cow", "Bird", and "Fish". All the features of Animal are the same among
                    different species. But cows, birds, and fish have their own specialized methods. One can give milk,
                    the other can fly, and the last can swim. Finally, keep in mind that all cows are animals but not
                    all animals are cow.</li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <h4>OOP Syntax</h4>
            <ul class="p-main">
                <li><strong>class: </strong>A collection of related fields (instance and class variables) and methods
                    that have one purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>constructor: </strong>A constructor is a method with the same name as the class. When an
                    object is created, the constructor for that class is called. If no constructor is defined, a default
                    constructor is called. It's common to have multiple constructors taking different numbers of
                    parameters. Before a constructor is executed, the constructor for the parent class is called
                    implicitly if there is no parent constructor called explicitly on the first line.</li>
                <li>Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are
                    surrounded by curly braces.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>What is Bootstrap?</h4>
            <p class="p-main">Bootstrap is a free and open-source framework for CSS designed for responsive mobile-first
            web development. Bootstrap has a collection of design templates that users can utilize in order to make
            their web pages look presentable without having to learn a lot of CSS or HTML. Bootstrap lets you use tools
            like cards, navigation bars, and more to make your websites look better with less effort. On top of that,
            websites made with Bootstrap are more mobile-friendly.</p>
